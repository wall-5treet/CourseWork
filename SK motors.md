Project overview
The SK Motors Company application streamlines the auctioning of vehicles by automating the comparison of bids and calculating the remaining balances for winning bidders. It provides a clear summary of the transaction, including the net financial outcome for the company based on the initial investment.
Key features
	Vehicle Data Entry: Captures the unique registration number, original purchase cost, and additional expenses incurred.
	Bidding Logic: Accepts three separate bids and automatically identifies the highest offer.
	Financial Tracking: * Calculates the Balance Due after subtracting deposits from the winning bid.
	Computes Profit or Loss by comparing the winning bid against the sum of the vehicle cost and expenses.
Detailed Summary: Generates a formatted report for the final transaction.
How it works
The program follows a linear execution flow:
	Input Phase: The user enters the vehicle's "pedigree" (Cost and Reg No).
	Auction Phase: Three bidders submit their amounts.
	Evaluation Phase: The program uses a conditional logic block to determine the winningBid:
	$WinningBid = \max(bid_1, bid_2, bid_3)$
	Closing Phase: The user enters the deposits made by the winner, and the system outputs the final AUCTION SUMMARY.

Technical Specifications
a)	Language: Java
b)	Input Method: java.util.Scanner
c)	Logic Structures: If-else decision trees for bid comparison and profit/loss branching.
d)	Math Operations: Absolute value conversion (Math.abs) for displaying loss figures cleanly.
